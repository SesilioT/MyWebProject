# Sesilio Toribio - Official Website

## Overview
Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This project was built to showcase my background, interests, and technical skills in front-end development. Through this site, users can get to know more about me, view moments with loved ones in the photo gallery, explore a handful of my hobbies and weekly schedule, and contact me via a working form.

This project was created as part of my web development learning journey using HTML and CSS.

## Reflections & Next Steps
This project helped reinforce my understanding of HTML structure, responsive design, and styling with CSS. I enjoyed working on the layout, image presentation, and implementing JavaScript-based interactivity.

In the future, I plan to:
- Add animations and transitions to the gallery
- Include a working backend for the contact form
- Expand it into a multi-page portfolio site
